The files in this directory are for generating the dialog boxes. These have been generated using 
wxFormBuilder. The 'fbp' files have been provided.

To modify these use the fbp files within wxFormBuilder. When you edit the files you can generate both the 
Dialog and Impl files, but only copy the Dialog files to 'src' and 'include'. You should look at the 
generated Impl files and make any required changes in the src and imple files by hand. This is the only 
way to preserve the integrity of the current files.

If you make changes be sure to commit all files in this directory to git.
